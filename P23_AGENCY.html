<p><span style="background: #ffff00">The following terms and their respective definitions describe <strong>agency</strong> as an <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emergent property</a> of a sufficiently complex <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information</a> processing system which enables that information processing system to generate a virtual model its (apparently) encompassing physical environment and to interact with that environment such that the (apparently finite in terms of space and time) information processing agent is able to achieve that information processing agent&#8217;s goals.</span></p>

<p><strong>AGENCY:</strong> an information processing agent&#8217;s ability to understand and to control <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reality</a>.</p>
<p>Not all information processing agents have the same degree of agency. In general, the agency of an information processing agent can be measured in terms of respective decision making complexity which includes <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantifiable</a> factors such as data throughput capacity (e.g. <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bits</a> per second), modeled decision making outcomes (e.g. number of options for a decision at a given point in an information processing agent&#8217;s environment modeling runtime), amount of accumulated non redundant <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memorized</a> information which that information processing agent learned from past decision making experiences (e.g. bits of data stored), and decision making <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">algorithm</a> efficiency (e.g. <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big O notation</a>).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>INFORMATION_PROCESSING_AGENT:</strong> a finite allocation of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">space</a>, <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time</a>, <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matter</a>, and <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">energy</a> which are arranged in a relatively stable pattern and which renders perceptions, makes decisions using a process of elimination to reduce multiple behavior options down to exactly one option, and executes decision-making outcomes as a means to attain that information processing agent’s goals.</p>
<p>Not all objects are necessarily information processing agents (though it could be argued that every object in <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nature</a> is an information processing agent given the fact that every object can be classified as a piece of information which changes its attributes in (apparent) response to other pieces of information changing their attributes).</p>
<p>An example of a relatively simple information processing agent is a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virus</a>. Unlike the relatively complex <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cells</a> which a virus attaches to and injects its genetic material into in order to exploit that cell&#8217;s internal machinery to produce copies of that virus, a virus does not consume energy. A cell, by contrast, consumes energy and makes rudimentary decisions based on chemical inputs. For example, chemical receptors in a cell&#8217;s outer membrane switch specific <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gene</a> transcription processes for building specific corresponding <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protein</a> structures on or off in response to those <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">receptors</a> detecting specific molecular inputs such as <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hormones</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>GOAL:</strong> a set of imaginary conditions which an information processing agent conceives of and which compel that information processing agent to implement specific actions which that information processing agent thinks will <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality_(physics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cause</a> those imaginary conditions to become realized by that information processing agent as phenomena in that information processing agent&#8217;s future environment.</p>
<p>An example of rudimentary goal-oriented behavior is a C++ program which sets an int type variable named X to some <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">random</a> integer using a specific function and then, if the value of X is not equal to the goal state of 9, that random integer function will be called and the value of X will be set to the value returned by that function until the value of X is equal to the goal state of 9.</p>
<pre>int X = generate_random_integer();
while (X != 9) X = generate_random_integer();
</pre>
<hr>
<p><strong>ENVIRONMENT:</strong> the finite set of phenomena which an information processing agent renders and perceives as being external to that information processing agent’s spatially finite and temporally finite body.</p>
<p>Note that it is possible for an information processing agent to perceive no boundary between its body and its environment. If that is the case, that information processing agent would perceive itself as having no agency (and agency is defined as an information processing agent appearing to itself to have some degree of control over which phenomena appear and which phenomena disappear inside of that information processing agent’s perceptual field).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PERCEPTION:</strong> an information processing agent rendering phenomena inside of that agent’s frame of reference as a result of that information processing agent (a) receiving “low level” sensory input data through that information processing agent’s sensory organs, (b) retrieving “middle level” sensory and conceptual throughput data which that information processing agent previously encoded and stored as memories inside of that information processing agent’s long-term information storage apparatus, and (c) generating “high level” conceptual throughput data which that information processing agent synthesizes from retrieved memories and from incoming sensory input.</p>
<pre>/**
 * An information processing agent’s most 
 * recent perception could be described as a 
 * function whose input is that information 
 * processing agent’s most recent execution.
 */
perception := execution(time_i). // perception occurs at time_i + 1
</pre>
<hr>
<p><strong>DECISION:</strong> an information processing agent (a) imagining a finite set of multiple options for how that information processing agent could behave and then (b) using an algorithmic process of elimination to iteratively reduce that set of options down to exactly one option (and that one remaining option is what the information processing agent selects as the planned action to implement in order to make progress towards achieving that information processing agent&#8217;s goal).</p>
<pre>/**
 * An information processing agent’s most 
 * recent decision could be described as a 
 * function whose input is that information 
 * processing agent’s most recent perception.
 */
decision := perception(time_i). // decision occurs at time_i + 1
</pre>
<hr>
<p><strong>EXECUTION:</strong> an information processing agent performing <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">physical work</a> by manipulating objects in that information processing agent&#8217;s environment (including that information processing agent&#8217;s own body) in order to implement a decision which that information processing agent made.</p>
<pre>/**
 * An information processing agent’s most
 * recent execution could be described as a
 * function whose input is that information
 * processing agent’s most recent decision.
 */
execution := decision(time_i). // action occurs at time_i + 1

(The following quoted text was published as a Twitter post by karbytes on 05_SEPTEMBER_2023: <u>‘Perhaps free will is willed into existence by an information processing agent such that the information processing agent can, at some arbitrary point in time and space, consciously decide whether or not to increase that agent&#8217;s free will or else to decrease that agent&#8217;s free will. To increase free will takes a finite amount of energy for the task of imagining future outcomes to a decision which each would occur as a result of the respective information processing agent taking a specific corresponding action (and one action of multiple possible actions which that information processing agent imagines and then decides to implement through some algorithmic process of elimination). To decrease free will is to exert zero or only some trivial amount of energy towards imagining future outcomes and how to effect a desired outcome using planned actions. Hence, breathing typically takes little free will compared to walking through a maze.’</u>)

(The following quoted text was published as a Twitter post by karbytes on 18_AUGUST_2023: <u>‘&#8221;I have a hypothesis that all information processing agents (especially humans) are each instantiated out of an omniscient, ubiquitous, and irreducible substrate such that the instantiated object experiences (for the duration of that object&#8217;s lifespan) a partial rather than omniscient form of intelligence. I also think that, at some level (however subconsciously to the exhibiting information processing agent), the agent knows that it is a zoomed-in partition of omniscience and of limitless instantiation possibilities. Perhaps that zoomed-in partition is reflexively being manipulated by all other of such partitions (though some of those partitions may have more information processing (and hence more reality shaping) capabilities than do some other partitions).&#8221; &#8211; karbytes
