<p>S: &#8220;Are numbers noumena or are numbers phenomena?&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;I would say that any finite sequence of numeric digits (which includes either zero or else one radix and either zero or else one sign) which is currently being represented as a pattern of physical objects inside of some information processing agent&#8217;s hardware (even if that information processing agent is merely a component of a software simulation) is a number which exists as a phenomenon from the perspective of that information processing agent&#8217;s encompassing universe. In other words, the only numbers I consider to actually exist are the values (which phenotypically manifest as finite linear sequences of numeric digits (with no more than one radix per sequence and no more than one sign per sequence)) which are currently being represented by whatever computer program variables are currently instantiated. I believe that most numbers which are theorized to exist are each in a purely noumenal state most of the time rather than in a phenomenal state most of the time (though I could be wrong (especially if all imaginable phenomena exist simultaneously and eternally throughout a limitlessly large set of parallel and temporally circular universes)).&#8221;</p>
<p>S: &#8220;Are you suggesting that, if all imaginable phenomena exist simultaneously and eternally throughout a limitlessly large set of parallel and temporally circular universes, there are as many phenomenal numbers as there are noumenal numbers (from the perspective of an all-encompassing multiverse)?&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;Initially, I am inclined to say yes to your question because, if all imaginable phenomena exist simultaneously and eternally throughout a limitlessly large set of isolated and limitlessly repeating universes, then there are infinitely many phenomenal incarnations of each noumenal number throughout all time (i.e. throughout the boundlessly large multiverse). I do not think it is possible for a spatially and temporally finite information processing agent to algebraically compare two infinities the way that information processing agent can algebraically compare the numbers 5 and 2 (to see that there is a precise difference of 3 spaces on the number line between the points labeled 2 and 5). Hence, I reason that any object is always either known (to some beholder) as a spatially, temporally, and energetically finite pattern or else that object is not known to that particular beholder and possibly neither to any other beholders.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following paragraphs (enclosed inside of quotation marks) are modified excerpts from a journal entry which was written by karbytes on 07_OCTOBER_2023.</p>
<p>&#8216;&#8230;Science is the &#8220;vehicle&#8221; by which I traverse a simulation I may have created but have since forgotten that I created. Within the simulated universe I created I also instantiated into as an avatar with agency and with self awareness (and with self aware agency which could seamlessly traverse infinitely many different levels of simulated reality as one continuous space-time continuum (and each of those levels of simulated reality can be conceptually modeled as a &#8220;middle level&#8221; spherical shell inside of a nested series of spherical shells))&#8230;</p>
<p>It may be the case that there are infinitely many parallel versions of me each inside of its own uniquely corresponding solipsistic universe (which is fundamentally a computer simulation using discrete rather than continuous values for constituting objects with mass). Note that discrete (rather than continuous) signals can be verbatim encoded as sequences of binary digits which two information processing machines each decode to produce the same qualitative value.</p>
<p>It may be the case that there exist infinitely many parallel universes (which are each a simulation being run on a digital computer) such that each of those simulated versions of me (and that me&#8217;s respective universe) is a simulation which some parallel me built.</p>
<p><u>In order for <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/count_down_timer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time</a> to exist, it seems that there needs to be some kind of (self aware) <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> experiencing exactly one space-time continuum.</u> I think that time is entirely subjective rather than objective and that, from the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiverse&#8217;s</a> (most macroscopic) perspective, all moments are eternally frozen (i.e. changeless) and eternally instantiated.&#8217;</p>
<hr>
<p>The following paragraph is a clarification which karbytes wanted to make to the copied and modified journal entry excerpts in the previous section of this web page:</p>
<p>&#8220;When I suggested that all phenomena are fundamentally comprised of discrete values rather than continuous values, I did not mean to suggest that analog signals do not exist. I do believe that the universe I inhabit is a ubiquitous field through which <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electromagnetic</a> waves and <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gravity</a> waves are propagated (and a wave appears to encompass infinitely many discrete values because the wave itself fills the gaps between discrete objects with mass with something which appears to me to be the most noumenal form of phenomena: pure energy. It may be the case that the entire universe I (and presumably you) inhabit fundamentally consists of a ubiquitous field comprised of pure energy (and matter is energy rendered observable, measurably finite, and exhibiting distinct qualitative features).&#8221;</p>

<p>The following paragraphs are an excerpt taken from a journal entry which was written by karbytes on 12_OCTOBER_2023:</p>
<p>S0: &#8220;If an information processing agent (and the universe in which that information processing agent appears to itself to be inhabiting) is coerced into remaining instantiated for an infinitely long period of time (starting at some arbitrary point in time along that universe&#8217;s timeline zero or else some natural number of units of time after the point in time along that timeline in which that information processing agent materialized into whatever universe that information processing agent perceives itself as being at the epicenter of for the duration of that information processing agent&#8217;s lifespan), is it inevitable that the information processing agent would experience all imaginable timelines?&#8221;</p>
<p>T0: &#8220;No. Logically speaking, it is impossible for that information processing agent to eventually experience all noumena as phenomena because, in order for that information processing agent to exist and for the laws of physics which govern that information processing agent&#8217;s encompassing universe to be applied consistently and ubiquitously (within the context of that particular universe while excluding every other universe which ever occurs throughout some all-encompassing multiverse), the information processing agent would only be allowed to experience some noumena expressed as their uniquely corresponding phenomena instead of all noumena expressed as their uniquely corresponding phenomena. That is because each phenomenon which that information processing agent observes is a unique allocation of time, space, matter, and energy instead of something which can be instantiated multiple times. <u>Each phenomenon is an event which occurs exactly one time (within that phenomenon&#8217;s encompassing universe and from the subjective vantage of exactly one information processing agent which renders a mental simulation of that universe).</u> An information processing agent such as karbytes appears to (at least temporarily) be constrained to a reality simulation in which time appears to move in exactly one direction and at a constant speed. If karbytes (and the universe which karbytes inhabits) is allowed to keep existing in material form (even if that universe is merely a software simulation being run on some relatively physical computer hardware) for an infinitely long period of time, karbytes would always be experiencing some type of transient phenomena whose spatial, temporal, and qualitative features are finite (and apparently changeless phenomena such as a monotone beep continuously being emitted and registered by karbytes could be conceptually modeled as a one-dimensional array comprised of contiguous equally-sized cells which each represent some unit-length of universe modeling computation time such that each of those cells contains energy-matter configuration data which is identical to its neighboring cell&#8217;s energy-matter configuration data). During that infinitely long time period, karbytes would have infinitely many unique phenomena to experience, but karbytes would not be able to experience all imaginable phenomena unless karbytes splits into infinitely many parallel versions of itself. That is because some imaginable phenomena include very limiting conditions such as the imaginable (i.e. hypothetical (i.e. still nounemal from our shared vantage)) phenomenon of an infinitely repeating sequence of events within some universe.&#8221;</p>
<p>S0: &#8220;During some infinitely long period of time in which karbytes is allowed (or forced) to stay alive,  karbytes is assumed by some information processing agents to eventually and, hence, inevitably, generate a copy of karbytes&#8217; encompassing universe which is run on some hardware computer inside of karbytes&#8217; universe. In order for karbytes to experience all imaginable phenomena (i.e. in order for karbytes to experience each unique noumenon as its uniquely corresponding phenomenon), karbytes would necessarily have to instantiate (personally or by delegation to virtual clones) into limitlessly many parallel universes in order for karbytes or some virtual clone of karbytes to experience each imaginable sequence of events. Perhaps karbytes will create a software simulation of karbytes&#8217; entire encompassing physical universe such that multiple instances of karbytes can concur (such that a multiverse is instantiated which is not located inside of the same universe which houses that multiverse simulation&#8217;s substantiating hardware).&#8221;</p>
<p>T0: &#8220;If karbytes is able to create a multiverse simulation which has infinite computational resources (i.e. runtime, energy, underlying hardware integrity stability), karbytes could technically model anything imaginable (but what I said about each phenomenon being the only instance of its kind (throughout all of nature or, at the very least, throughout all of one universe (such that the simulation is literally the same entity as the universe which that simulation models)) still applies to this situation).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;<u>Given infinite time (from the vantage of an all-encompassing multiverse), it is undetermined (from my current vantage as a non-omniscient information processing agent) whether all noumena will eventually manifest as phenomena or else whether some noumena remain purely noumenal (i.e. never instantiate as phenomena).</u>&#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p>(The following quoted text is a copy of a Twitter post which karbytes posted on 07_NOVEMBER_2023): <u>&#8220;The probability that something other than pure nothingness exists throughout all existence is always larger than zero percent. The fact that this sentence is being read right now is proof that the previous sentence is true.&#8221;</u></p>
